        Find the correct index and create two lists using slicing.

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, what should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>After reading about <a target="_blank" href="https://railsware.com/blog/python-for-machine-learning-indexing-and-slicing-for-lists-tuples-strings-and-other-sequential-types/">slicing</a>,
        you may already write the <b class="code">return</b> statement,
        where <b class="code">ind</b> is the index of element of the input list, which would be the
        first element of the second list inside output Iterable:</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
return [items[:ind], items[ind:]] # if you return list as well        
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I see, but how to find out that index?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>For example, let's take a list with even number of elements, where elements
        are the same as indexes for convenience (indexes start from 0 in Python) - <b class="code">[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</b>.</p>
        <p>So, the element (and index) you need is 3. If you take the closest smaller
        list with odd number of elements <b class="code">[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</b> you discover, that you need
        the same element (and index) 3.</p>
        <p>So, for the list with odd number of elements
        you need the same index as for the next one with even numbers. This result of
        calculation would be achieved by such expression:</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
ind = (len(items) + 1) // 2
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>You just need to join previous hints together and wrap you code in
        function expressions (type hints are recommended):</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Any, Iterable


def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    ind = (len(items) + 1) // 2
        
    return [items[:ind], items[ind:]]        
        </pre>
    </div>

        'Cause I wanna be a real Python Ninnjaa!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Sure, grab it!</p>
        <p>With using <b class="code">math</b> module (round up with ceiling) you don't need adding 1 to
        the length of sequence.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Any, Iterable
import math


def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    half = math.ceil(len(items)/2)

    return [items[:half], items[half:]]
        </pre>
        <p>This solution uses interesting list method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_pop.asp">list.pop()</a>.
        It removes and return value from a list with specific index. So you remove
        needed number of elements, insert them into new list. And you include the
        input list as the second output list since it's already without elements, 
        included in the first list!</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Any, Iterable


def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    return [[items.pop(0) for _ in range((len(items)+1)//2)], items]
