        This mission is about slicing the list. Find the correct index and create
        two lists using slicing.

        So, what should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        After reading about <a target="_blank" href="https://railsware.com/blog/python-for-machine-learning-indexing-and-slicing-for-lists-tuples-strings-and-other-sequential-types/">slicing</a>,
        you may already write the return statement (if you return list as well),
        where "ind" is the index of element of the input list, which would the
        first element of the second list inside output Iterable:    
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
return [items[:ind], items[ind:]]        
        </pre>

    <div class="question">
        I see, but how to find out that index?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For example, let's take a list with even number of elements, where elements
        are the same as indexes for convenience (indexes start from 0 in Python) - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
        So, the element(and index) you need is 3. If you take a closest smaller
        list with odd number of element [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] you discover, that you need
        the same element (and index) 3. So, for the list with odd number of elements
        you need the same index as for the next one with even numbers. This result of
        calculation would be achieved by such expression:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
ind = (len(items) + 1) // 2
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You just need to join previous hints together and wrap you code inside
        function expressions (type hints are recommended):
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    ind = (len(items) + 1) // 2
        
    return [items[:ind], items[ind:]]        
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        Sure, grab it!<br />
        With using math module (round up with ceiling) you don't need adding 1 to
        the length of sequence. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
import math


def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    half = math.ceil(len(items)/2)

    return [items[:half], items[half:]]
        </pre>
        This solution uses interesting list method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_pop.asp">pop()</a>.
        It removes and return value from list with specific index. So you remove
        needed number of elements, insert them into new list. And you include the
        input list as the second output list since its already without elements, 
        included in the first list!
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def split_list(items: list[Any]) -> Iterable[list[Any]]:

    return [[items.pop(0) for _ in range((len(items)+1)//2)], items]
        </pre>
